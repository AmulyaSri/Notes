How to update emacs org-mode 7.9 to 8.0?

I downloaded the org-mode from git and followed the instructions from the following url.

Notes: 

1. Number system

n = a^p.b^q.c^r
No of factors: (p+1). (q+1).(r+1)
No of odd factors: if p is even prime number and q and r are odd prime numbers then, 
(q+1) .(r+1) = no of odd factors
No of even factors = total factors - no of odd factors

Possible no of ways which we can express number as a product of 2numbers : 
Case 1: if number is not perfect square : no. of factors /2.
Case 2: if number is perfect square, then, number of factors+1/2.

If number is perfect square and no of distinuished factors = No of factors -1/2
